<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Webpage Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This apartment management system simplifies the communication between landlords, tenants, and maintenance. The system will be web-based allowing multiple parties to log in. Landlords will be able to charge rent and update records. Maintenance will be able to see the current maintenance requests and update the requests as complete or in progress. Tenants will be able to file requests for maintenance, complaints, pay rent, and see 
the various information about their specific room. Overall, this system will provide a desirable user experience for the landlords, tenants, and maintenance to easily manage and communicate with one another to fulfill each personâ€™s needs.
